# Final Projects Weeks

Work in teams to produce your own app idea with technologies of your choice.

At the end of the project, each team will present the great work done! They will talk through a slide deck and do a quick demo of their project. Communicate about your learning, technical achievements, and show off your cool project to the rest of your cohort, family and friends. It's Demo Day!

## ThereAndBack App

### Team name: JAZE

The final project created by team JAZE ([Jed Stanton](https://github.com/JStant95), [Andrew Hulme](https://github.com/AndrewHulme), [Zsofia Szonyi](https://github.com/ZsofiaS), [Ed Ancerys](https://github.com/EdAncerys)) at Makers Academy.

Inspiration behind the project: We have created a route planning app, that specialises in creating round trips for walkers, runners and cyclists. This was inspired by our own struggles to find new walking, running and cycling routes in our area during lockdown.

# Specification

The app aims to solve the problem of the user who wants to find a circular route for outdoor activities (walking, cycling, hiking).
The user can view the map and search for routes without logging in, either circular routes, or routes between a start and end point. Different activity types can be selected, and the result can be randomised.
Once the user is logged in, favourite routes can be saved in _My Routes_ and can be viewed on the map, or they can be removed from the list.
