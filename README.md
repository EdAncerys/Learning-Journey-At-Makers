## My Makers Journal

During my 12 weeks at Makers Bootcamp, I have grown as a person and as a developer.

The table below has a summary of the following content:

- Goals: every week was designed to cover different knowledge areas.
- Projects: most of them are done in the afternoons, pairing with a different colleague every day. (Weeks 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12 are group projects. Week 10 is individual work)
- Weekend Challenges: designed to be done individually and to reinforce the knowledge acquired during the week.
- Journal: every day I wrote about my learning and challenges while at Makers. Descriptions of the projects and end of the week reflections.
