# Week 1 Goals 

- Test-driven a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP


## Daily Goals 
### Wednesday 15 of April 2020

## Morning Goals 

*Be able to explain what is **encapsulation**, why and where it is used.*

**Plan:**
- Perform research on-line individually. 
- Discuss research findings in group.  
- Describe what is **encapsulation** and its usage. 
- Give some practical example for encapsulation.

**What we learned:**   
> - Encapsulation process is an important part of programming and it can be defined as wrapping up data under a single unit.   
- To **"encapsulate"** means to enclose variables, functions or methods into a small group or object.  
- **Encapsulation** in OOP is commonly done by *“wrapping”* up objects into classes by changing the scope of these objects (or/and simply hiding the data by preventing "data pollution").

    *Object Encapsulation* 
</p>

**Encapsulation** can be illustrated as per the example above, where we have defined class object named *"ObjectEncapsulation"* and a variable defined below it. In all cases, the same variable name has been used (as well as the same variable "user" in class been defined three times).  
By defining a new instance of the class *"ObjectEncapsulation"* and calling methods defined in the class, as per above, we getting different output every time despite the same variable name.

```
p user 
user = ObjectEncapsulation.new
p user.name_one
p user.name_two 

```


## Afternoon Challenges  
Practice pairing and Test-Driven development.

**Plan:** 
Pair with Jed and start working through the afternoon challenge for the week "Boris Bikes".

**Process:**
